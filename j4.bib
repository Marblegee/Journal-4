	abstract = {In the last few years, Micro-C has shown itself as an improved alternative to Hi-C. It replaced the restriction enzymes in Hi-C assays with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), resulting in capturing nucleosome resolution chromatin interactions. The signal-to-noise improvement of Micro-C allows it to detect more chromatin loops than high-resolution Hi-C. However, compared with massive Hi-C datasets available in the literature, there are only a limited number of Micro-C datasets. To take full advantage of these Hi-C datasets, we present HiC2MicroC, a computational method learning and then predicting Micro-C from Hi-C based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM). We trained our DDPM and other regression models in human foreskin fibroblast (HFFc6) cell line and evaluated these methods in six different cell types at 5-kb and 1-kb resolution. Our evaluations demonstrate that both HiC2MicroC and regression methods can markedly improve Hi-C towards Micro-C, and our DDPM-based HiC2MicroC outperforms regression in various terms. First, HiC2MicroC successfully recovers most of the Micro-C loops even those not detected in Hi-C maps. Second, a majority of the HiC2MicroC-recovered loops anchor CTCF binding sites in a convergent orientation. Third, HiC2MicroC loops share genomic and epigenetic properties with Micro-C loops, including linking promoters and enhancers, and their anchors are enriched for structural proteins (CTCF and cohesin) and histone modifications. Lastly, we find our recovered loops are also consistent with the loops identified from promoter capture Micro-C (PCMicro-C) and Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET). Overall, HiC2MicroC is an effective tool for further studying Hi-C data with Micro-C as a template. HiC2MicroC is publicly available at https://github.com/zwang-bioinformatics/HiC2MicroC/.},

	abstract = {Motivation: High-resolution Hi-C data, capable of detecting chromatin features below the level of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), significantly enhance our understanding of gene regulation. Micro-C, a variant of Hi-C incorporating a micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion step to examine interactions between nucleosome pairs, has been developed to overcome the resolution limitations of Hi-C. However, Micro-C experiments pose greater technical challenges compared to Hi-C, owing to the need for precise MNase digestion control and higher-resolution sequencing. Therefore, developing computational methods to derive Micro-C data from existing Hi-C datasets could lead to better usage of a large amount of existing Hi-C data in the scientific community and cost savings. Results: We developed C2c (“high” or upper case C to “micro” or lower case c), a computational tool based on a residual neural network to learn the mapping between Hi-C and Micro-C contact matrices and then predict Micro-C contact matrices based on Hi-C contact matrices. Our evaluation results show that the predicted Micro-C contact matrices reveal more chromatin loops than the input Hi-C contact matrices, and more of the loops detected from predicted Micro-C match the promoter–enhancer interactions. Furthermore, we found that the mutual loops from real and predicted Micro-C better match the ChIA-PET data compared to Hi-C and real Micro-C loops, and the predicted Micro-C leads to more TAD-boundaries detected compared to the Hi-C data.

As sequencing costs have dropped, thousands of new genomes have been sequenced, and scientists have come to realize that a single reference genome is inadequate for many purposes. By sampling a diverse set of individuals, one can begin to assemble a pan-genome: a collection of all the DNA sequences that occur in a species. Here we review efforts to create pan-genomes for a range of species, from bacteria to humans, and we further consider the computational methods that have been proposed in order to capture, interpret and compare pan-genome data. As scientists continue to survey and catalogue the genomic variation across human populations and begin to assemble a human pan-genome, these efforts will increase our power to connect variation to human diversity, disease and beyond.},

	abstract = {Horizontal transfer, gene loss, and duplication result in dynamic bacterial genomes shaped by a complex mixture of different modes of evolution. Closely related strains can differ in the presence or absence of many genes, and the total number of distinct genes found in a set of related isolates—the pan-genome—is often many times larger than the genome of individual isolates. We have developed a pipeline that efficiently identifies orthologous gene clusters in the pan-genome. This pipeline is coupled to a powerful yet easy-to-use web-based visualization for interactive exploration of the pan-genome. The visualization consists of connected components that allow rapid filtering and searching of genes and inspection of their evolutionary history. For each gene cluster, panX displays an alignment, a phylogenetic tree, maps mutations within that cluster to the branches of the tree and infers gain and loss of genes on the core-genome phylogeny. PanX is available at pangenome.de. Custom pan-genomes can be visualized either using a web server or by serving panX locally as a browser-based application.},

	abstract = {Many recent studies have emphasized the important role of structural variation (SV) in determining human genetic and phenotypic variation. In plants, studies aimed at elucidating the extent of SV are still in their infancy. Evidence has indicated a high presence and an active role of SV in driving plant genome evolution in different plant species.With the aim of characterizing the size and the composition of the poplar pan-genome, we performed a genome-wide analysis of structural variation in three intercrossable poplar species: Populus nigra, Populus deltoides, and Populus trichocarpa. We detected a total of 7,889 deletions and 10,586 insertions relative to the P. trichocarpa reference genome, covering respectively 33.2 Mb and 62.9 Mb of genomic sequence, and 3,230 genes affected by copy number variation (CNV). The majority of the detected variants are inter-specific in agreement with a recent origin following separation of species.Insertions and deletions (INDELs) were preferentially located in low-gene density regions of the poplar genome and were, for the majority, associated with the activity of transposable elements. Genes affected by SV showed lower-than-average expression levels and higher levels of dN/dS, suggesting that they are subject to relaxed selective pressure or correspond to pseudogenes.Functional annotation of genes affected by INDELs showed over-representation of categories associated with transposable elements activity, while genes affected by genic CNVs showed enrichment in categories related to resistance to stress and pathogens. This study provides a genome-wide catalogue of SV and the first insight on functional and structural properties of the poplar pan-genome.},

	abstract = {Pigs were domesticated independently in the Near East and China, indicating that a single reference genome from one individual is unable to represent the full spectrum of divergent sequences in pigs worldwide. Therefore, 12 de novo pig assemblies from Eurasia were compared in this study to identify the missing sequences from the reference genome. As a result, 72.5 Mb of non-redundant sequences (∼3\% of the genome) were found to be absent from the reference genome (Sscrofa11.1) and were defined as pan-sequences. Of the pan-sequences, 9.0 Mb were dominant in Chinese pigs, in contrast with their low frequency in European pigs. One sequence dominant in Chinese pigs contained the complete genic region of the tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG3) gene which is involved in fatty acid metabolism. Using flanking sequences and Hi-C based methods, 27.7\% of the sequences could be anchored to the reference genome. The supplementation of these sequences could contribute to the accurate interpretation of the 3D chromatin structure. A web-based pan-genome database was further provided to serve as a primary resource for exploration of genetic diversity and promote pig breeding and biomedical research.},

	abstract = {The human reference genome is the most widely used resource in human genetics and is due for a major update. Its current structure is a linear composite of merged haplotypes from more than 20 people, with a single individual comprising most of the sequence. It contains biases and errors within a framework that does not represent global human genomic variation. A high-quality reference with global representation of common variants, including single-nucleotide variants, structural variants and functional elements, is needed. The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium aims to create a more sophisticated and complete human reference genome with a graph-based, telomere-to-telomere representation of global genomic diversity. Here we leverage innovations in technology, study design and global partnerships with the goal of constructing the highest-possible quality human pangenome reference. Our goal is to improve data representation and streamline analyses to enable routine assembly of complete diploid genomes. With attention to ethical frameworks, the human pangenome reference will contain a more accurate and diverse representation of global genomic variation, improve gene–disease association studies across populations, expand the scope of genomics research to the most repetitive and polymorphic regions of the genome, and serve as the ultimate genetic resource for future biomedical research and precision medicine.},

However, the extent and functional significance of NRSs in the human genomes and populations remains unclear. Here, we de novo assembled 539 genomes from five genetically divergent human populations using long-read sequencing technology, resulting in the identification of 5.1 million NRSs. These were merged into 45284 unique NRSs, with 29.7\% being novel discoveries. Among these NRSs, 38.7\% were common across the five populations, and 35.6\% were population specific. The use of a graph-based pangenome approach allowed for the detection of 565 transcript expression quantitative trait loci on NRSs, with 426 of these being novel findings. Moreover, 26 NRS candidates displayed evidence of adaptive selection within human populations. Genes situated in close proximity to or intersecting with these candidates may be associated with metabolism and type 2 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies revealed 14 NRSs to be significantly associated with eight phenotypes. Additionally, 154 NRSs were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with 258 phenotype-associated SNPs in the GWAS catalogue. Our work expands the understanding of human NRSs and provides novel insights into their functions, facilitating evolutionary and biomedical researches.},
